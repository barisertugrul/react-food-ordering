This project was developed thanks to the [React (Next.js) ile Full Stack Yemek Sipariş Projesi](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-nextjs-ile-full-stack-yemek-siparis-projesi) course available on Udemy.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


Demo: [https://react-food-ordering-six.vercel.app/](https://react-food-ordering-six.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First,
You must create a MongoDB ([https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/)) account for the project and add a database.
Cretae a Cloudinary Account ([https://cloudinary.com/](https://cloudinary.com/))
You should also rename the .env.example file to .env and fill in the necessary information in its content.


Second run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
